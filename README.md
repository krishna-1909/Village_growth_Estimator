Village Growth Estimator
This project focuses on estimating the growth potential of a village based on key attributes including transportation accessibility, electricity availability, cleanliness, and crime rate. The goal is to provide insights into factors influencing village development and assist in strategic planning for infrastructure and community improvement.

Key Attributes for Estimation:
Transportation Accessibility: Evaluates the ease of travel and connectivity within and around the village, considering road infrastructure and public transportation options.
Electricity Availability: Assesses the reliability and coverage of electricity supply across the village, vital for residential, commercial, and industrial development.
Cleanliness: Measures the overall cleanliness and environmental quality of the village, reflecting community health and attractiveness for residents and visitors.
Crime Rate: Analyzes the level of safety and security within the village, impacting the quality of life and investment attractiveness.
Usage Instructions:
Input Data: Prepare input datasets containing quantitative or qualitative assessments of transportation, electricity, cleanliness, and crime rate for the village.
Run Estimation Model: Execute the growth estimation script (village_growth_estimator.py) to generate growth potential scores based on the provided attribute data.
Interpret Results: Review output files or visualizations to understand the estimated growth potential of the village relative to the input attributes.
Project Structure:
village_growth_estimator.py: Main script for calculating growth potential scores based on attribute inputs.
transportation.csv, electricity.csv, cleanliness.csv, crime_rate.csv: Input files containing attribute data for transportation, electricity, cleanliness, and crime rate.
growth_scores.csv: Output file containing growth potential scores for the village based on the provided attribute data.
visualizations/: Directory containing visual representations (charts, graphs) of growth potential scores and attribute correlations.
Future Enhancements:
Incorporation of additional attributes (e.g., healthcare facilities, education quality) for a more comprehensive growth estimation model.
Integration with GIS (Geographic Information System) data for spatial analysis and visualization.
Note:
This project aims to aid village planners, policymakers, and stakeholders in making informed decisions regarding infrastructure development and community enhancement. Feedback and contributions are encouraged to enhance the accuracy and applicability of the village growth estimator system.
